### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Deploy to Firebase
After committing and pushing to GitHub, 
a build and deploy action will be triggered for the `dist` folder, 
so no manual `npm run build && firebase deploy` at the local machine is being required.
